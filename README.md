# YATTi (Yet Another Tracker of Time)

A time-tracking application for use by professional services employees. Tracks time based on project, instead of on day (e.g. Gallifrey).

# Status

This is currently a personal project of Richard "Ibb" Fears and so is not accepting any collaborators at the moment. Planned features and issues are being tracked on a personal Trac server: https://trac.ibbmarsh.com

Note that the long delay since a release (0.1.2 was finished on 2017-09-26) is partially due to the ramp-up of work at my job and partially due to the current ticket (42; non-data columns) requiring a significant rewrite of the data editor.

# Compatibility

YATTi was primarily written in Python 3.4 and 3.5 on a Windows machine. The latest commit commented out some minor code so it can run on Linux w/ Python 3.6, but it is likely not very stable there. The focus for Phase 1 is features. Phase 2 will focus on compatibility and usability.
