Add all of the following as tickets in whatever ticket-tracking system I use.

1) Checkbox for auto-pause other timers when starting a timer.
2) Button for quick-adding a new timer (with the ability to specify what it was for later).
2a) The quick-add should be possible even with another quick-add already existing.
3) When exporting time, radio-button for "One description per ticket/One description per timer" (never allow one description for an entire day or for an entire week of a ticket).
3a) When exporting time, give the option of exporting to Jira, CSV, or OpenAir-friendly CSV.
3b) Possibly also allow exporting to Trac (or whatever time-tracking software I use).
4) Provide date-selection box above the list of current timers.
4a) Selected date determines which timers are displayed.
5) Selecting a timer displays some editable information about it in the right pane, including the JIRA ticket number, the description of work done during that timer, and other such information.
6) Layout:

Obviously, we need a properly-drawn version of that. Legend: RO means read-only, while ticking means it updates as we sit on the page. Angle brackets indicate a button.
7) Within the timer button, the ticket number should be font size 20, while the description should be font size 11-12. Ideally, this would be configurable in the settings.
8) Add option to auto-merge timeslots if the new start time is within a reasonable interval from the most recent end time (or is before it).
9) The calendar should box the current day and highlight the selected day.
